# Welcome

The Purpose of this document is to understand that Finastra provides sandboxes with its core products, so that FinTechs and partners can connect to build, integrate, and test their innovative applications. A sandbox is a test environment with the same Finastra solutions that financial institutions are using across the world. The intended
audience is designers, developers and consumers of Finastra Open APIs available on the [Finastra Developer Portal](https://developer.fusionfabric.cloud/).
